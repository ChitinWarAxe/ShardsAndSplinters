# Shards & Splinters

Make your chitin war axe shatter while fighting cave rats!

## Features

This mod adds the chance for your weapon to break if you don’t take care of it. Most weapons can shatter, except for high-quality ones like adamantium, dwemer, and daedric. Artifact weapons are safe, your regular magical weapon is not.

When your weapon’s durability drops below a certain threshold, there’s a growing chance it might shatter mid-fight. Your luck attribute decreases this chance.

Will you be ready to face those Telvanni agents at the Caldera mine, and the 20 rats along the way? Will your iron longsword endure the stress? Should you bring some repair prongs or a backup weapon? Or both? It might be worth training your hand-to-hand skill too, just in case!

Tamriel Data items are supported.

## Configuration

Customize the mod to your liking with these settings:

* Enable or disable weapon shattering.
* **Durability Threshold:** Set the durability percentage at below which weapons are at risk.
* **Luck Modifier:** Negativly affects how luck affects weapon breaking chances. (A bigger number increases the chance.)
* **Whitelisted Materials and Types:** List of materials and weapons that won’t shatter. The keywords are based on the model name of the weapon.
* **Debug Log:** Toggle extra console information for debugging.

## Roadmap

* Add chance of weapons shattering - **DONE**
* Add chance of shields shattering - **TBD**
* Magical weapons explode upon shattering, causing their magical damage to you - **Not possible with OpenMW AFAIK** 

**This is my first-ever Lua mod for OpenMW. I hope you enjoy it!**
