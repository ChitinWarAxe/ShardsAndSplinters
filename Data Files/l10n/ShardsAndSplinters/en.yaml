description:
"Adds the chance for your weapon to break if you don’t take care of it. Most weapons can shatter, except for high-quality ones like adamantium, dwemer, and daedric. Artifact weapons are safe, your regular magical weapon is not. \n\n
When your weapon’s durability drops below a certain threshold, there’s a growing chance it might shatter mid-fight. Your luck attribute decreases this chance."
