  Adds the chance for your weapons and shields to break if you don’t take care of them. Most items can shatter, except for high-quality ones like adamantium, dwemer, and daedric. Artifact weapons and shields are safe, but regular magical items are not.
  
  When an item's durability drops below a certain threshold, there’s an increasing chance it might shatter mid-fight. Your luck attribute decreases this chance.
